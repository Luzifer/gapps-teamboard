# Team Dashboard

## The experiment

This is an experiment. Some key success indicators could be:

 - The Spreadsheet is more up-to-date than the analog walls
 - People are using the board (track it within GA or another metrics system?)
 - Wrong information (e.g. orphaned team members) is cleaned up because it's
   visible now.

## Goals

 - Display an up-do-date list of teams with their members, mission, vision,
   constraints and other interesting information. 
 - Make team mission, vision and constraints transparent.
 - Can be used by off-site teams as well
 - Can be displayed on a big screen or projector
 - Foster communication about team structure, maybe even reveal mission/vision
   conflicts
 - Reduce Monkey tasks of updating information which are available in Google
   Apps anyway
 - Make it easy to update the wall by using a "database" everyone can update 

## The future

 - Use native Google Apps teams feature
 - Make it more interactive, e.g. vote team mission/vision up/down or add comments
